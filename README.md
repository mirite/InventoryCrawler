# InventoryCrawler
Should probably rename this, but this app will crawl and download every page linked within a set domain. This allows for an easy list of all pages, any broken links (in the domain), and search the HTML for all of the pages within the domain. tool.py must be run before search.py so that search has a complete list of pages to work off of.
